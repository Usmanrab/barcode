## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to recap the previous codes which i've learnt for long


```html
<div>A div</Div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

### Continued development

i will like to focus more on flexbox, responsiveness of a website(media queries) and also be able to design a website perfectly with accurate measurement
